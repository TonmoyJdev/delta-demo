git clone file-Link
git status--> changes

file that already in git -> tracked
create new file -> untracked

untracked ()
unmodified () -> new file but not modified
modified () -> modify in file
staged () -> commit here


commit in two states: 
add -> modified to staged -> adds new or changed files into working direcotry

commit -> final -> it is the record of change -> with some messages


git push origin main

git init -> for making new repository

# new project was created from local system
steps:

1. init
2. git add .
3. git commit -m "cmnt1"
4. create repository in github
5. git remote add origin <git link>
6. git remote -v for checking from where push fetch


git branch -> to check branch
git branch -M main

if we use (git push -u origin main) then we don't need to write origin again and again


commit + add -> git commit -am "message"
